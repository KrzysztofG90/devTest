# devTest

The solutions of the tasks.

- I created a console application that includes all three tasks. After starting the app, selection menu appears. To
  select a specific task, enter and confirm with the appropriate digit assigned to the tasks. Then the appropriate task
  will appear.


- For the first and second task, a menu for selecting the type of number input will appear. You can choose to input from
  the keyboard or from a file called 'input' in the 'resources' directory.


- In the second task, when typing from the keyboard, you also enter the sum of the pairs you want to find.


- In task number three, the 'input2' file is loaded, which is located in the 'resources' directory.


- In addition to the first task, I created an alternative solution that can be found on the branch 'firstTaskv2' in my
  repository.
